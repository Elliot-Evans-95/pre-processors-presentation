				<!-- WHAT IS A PRE PROCESSOR -->
				<section>
					<h2>What is a pre-processor</h2>

					<!-- NOTES -->
					<aside class="notes">
						A computer program or language that modifies data to conform with the requirements of another program or language.

						So in essence, you can write code how you want and it will be complied down to the language that it needs to be in.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<!-- WHY PRE PROCESSORS EXIST -->
				<section>
					<h2>Why pre-processors exist</h2>

					<!-- NOTES -->
					<aside class="notes">
						One advantage of using a pre-processor is that you can write code has not yet made it into that particular languages spec.

						You can write cleaner code or use a way of writing that cannot be yet used and have it complied down to that language.

						Another advantage of a pre-processor is that it can change the paradigm of how you would write the code for that language.
						This can be a benefit if want a focus of one way of programming.

						Before I move onto to pre-processors I would like to talk about the differences between Compile
						and transpile as, at times, they can be seen as the same.

						A compiler usually produces a directly usable artifact. Such as C# and C.
						So the compiler transforms it into Intermediate language (IL)

						A transpiler produces another form of source code such as coffeescript (shrug) and babel (ESNext).
						So the compiler transforms it into javascript

					<script async src="https://static.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

					<!-- NOTES -->
					<aside class="notes">
						INTERFACES
						In TypeScript, two types are compatible if their internal structure is compatible. This allows us to implement an interface just by having the shape the interface requires, without an explicit implements clause.

						TYPE Annotations
						Type annotations in TypeScript are lightweight ways to record the intended contract of the function or variable. If the function returned something else it will throw an error before compiling.

						TYPE Definitions
						TypeScript supports type definitions for existing JavaScript libraries. TypeScript Definition file (with .d.ts extension) provides definition for external JavaScript libraries. Hence, TypeScript code can contain these libraries.

						COMPILER
						The TypeScript transpiler provides the error-checking feature. TypeScript will compile the code and generate compilation errors, if it finds some sort of syntax errors. This helps to highlight errors before the script is run.

						OO Programing
						TypeScript supports Object Oriented Programming concepts like classes, interfaces, inheritance, etc.

						ES6/7 SYNTAX
						Typescript has ES2015 + ES6 built into its syntax

						OPT-IN
						Idea that Typescript is very much opt in, you can still write javascript in typescript.

						TS LINT
						Due to the "opt in" mature of typescript we use linting tools

				<!-- FUTURE OF PRE PROCESSORS-->

					<h3>Future of pre processors</h3>


					<!-- NOTES -->
					<aside class="notes">
						From the examples that I have covered, pre-processors are a great aid to developers as they
						enhance what we can write today but what is there future?

						I believe that in time, they will be less need for pre-processors to a point there are are not needed at all.
						There is already work in progress in the Javascript and CSS community to take some parts of pro-processor
						languages and add them into the language (CSS variables, static methods and classes).

						From the information I have presented, I hope you all have an understanding of where we use pre-processors and how you use them. So next time you are in an app and need to write some typescript for some work, now you can without the FEDs telling you off.
